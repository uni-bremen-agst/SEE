    Let R (for roots) be the set of nodes in a view that have a Source.Name in NODE_NAMES
    and a node type in NODE_TYPES. Let descendants(root) be a function yielding
    all descendants nodes of node root in the node hierarchy spanned by any edge type 
    of either BELONGS_TO or derived from BELONGS_TO; in other words, descendants(root)
    consists of the transitive closure of all nodes reachable from root along
    BELONGS_TO edges in backward direction. Similarly, function ancestors(n) yields
    the transitive closure of all nodes reachable from node n along BELONGS_TO edges in 
    forward direction.
    
    Then H (for hierarchy) is defined as the union of descendants(r) over all r in R. All 
    nodes in H will be kept in the view. In addition, we want to keep the nodes at the 
    "fringes" of H along with their hierarchy. Nodes in the fringes, F, of H are
    all nodes not in H having an incoming or outgoing non-hierarchical edge to any 
    node in H. All nodes in F including their ancestors (union of ancestors(f) for
    all f in F) are kept, too.
    
    In addition to the nodes kept as described above, we keep all edges between 
    nodes that are to be kept (non-hierarchical and hierarchical). All other nodes
    and edges will be removed from the view.
    
    Returns the resulting modified graph.
