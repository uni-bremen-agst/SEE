For a folliage support please import Environment Package from Standard Unity assets (it has all models neccessary for folliage generation).
if you are using many trees, we suggest to edit LOD's of original tree file that can be found in folder "Assets\Standard Assets\Environment\SpeedTree\Broadleaf"
File name to edit is Broadleaf Mobile. I suggest You to set LOD factors to (in order off LOD's ):
100% LOD0
90% LOD1
70% LOD2
60% Billboard
40% Culled
if you are running your game on mobile device, trees might be too complex for rendering.
