For getting a best visual effect from demo scene:
-Set your project to "Linear color space" (EDIT/PROJECT SETTINGS/PLAYER)
-Import Standard Unity Character Asset Pack (Assets/Import Package/Characters)
-Import Unity Post Processing Stack from here:
https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/83912
I am reccomending to use in this moment a Post Pocessing Stack V.1, due to it's better Screen space reflections than one found in V2. As a city needs good reflections to simulate glasses, it can give you a better SSR quuality. 
Demo scenes doesn't contain any buildings, and they have to be built (this makes whole package lighter for download). 
This is done by selecting CScape City, and clicking on a Generate Streets Layout. Then Generate Buildings.. and so on. going into detailing your city.
