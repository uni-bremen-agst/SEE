To get startedd with Contend Developement Kit, you have to download Texture Sources from this link:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/8desklhixvtvr6g/CScapeToolsetSources.unitypackage?dl=0
After downloading, import this package into your Unity Project. 

Open the scene: "CScapeToolset", it is in the root of the CScape folder.
Select the "CscapeBaker" in the Hierarchy.
Set the lock icon (upper right) in the inspector so that the Baker does not move away as you adjust windows, etc.
Split your windows so you can see the Game and Scene side-by-side. The Game window will show you a 3D representation of what it will look like. The Scene view is 2D.
Set any of the 40 tiles as desired. (ie: add, remove, move windows and other objects within the Tile. Press the Previous/Next Tile buttons to navigate.
Press the "Bake Textures" button on the SCcape Toolset "CScape Toolset Manager" script
Switch back to game scene (in MY case the included CScapeDemo scene. I wanted to have a clean testbed, you do whatever you want.)
Select the "CScape City" in the Hierarchy
Find the "CS Materials Tools" script attached to the CScape City
Press the "Compile all textures" button.
