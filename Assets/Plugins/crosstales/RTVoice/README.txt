# RT-Voice PRO 2021.2.7

Thank you for buying our asset "RT-Voice PRO"!

Please don't forget to rate it or even better write a little review – it would be very much appreciated.



## Description
Did you ever want to make a game for people with visual impairments or reading difficulties? 
Or want your players to not have to read too much?
Or would you listen to just the dialogues in your game without consulting a voice-actor in early stages of development?

Then RT-Voice is your time-saving solution to do so!

RT-Voice uses TTS-voices already integrated in your system to pronounce any written text at runtime.
All of this happens without intermediate steps: the transformation effects instantaneously - and, if needed, simultaneously!

Please read the "RTVoice-doc.pdf" and "RTVoice-api.pdf" for more details.



## Upgrade to new version
Follow this steps to upgrade the version of "RT-Voice PRO":

1. Update "RT-Voice PRO" to the latest version from the "Unity AssetStore"
2. Inside the project in Unity, go to menu "File" => "New Scene"
3. Delete the "Assets/Plugins/crosstales/RTVoice" folder from the Project-view
4. Import the latest version from the "Unity AssetStore"



## Notes:

### iOS
On some device with iOS 13+ the voices can't be found.
This is due a bug of in the iOS-upgrade which corrupts the voices.
To solve it, go to the "Settings" (and look further for "Voices" or "Speech") on your device and re-install all needed voices.
