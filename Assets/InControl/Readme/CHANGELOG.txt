### v1.8.4
* Added `InputControlType.LeftCommand` and `InputControlType.RightCommand` aliases.

* Added beta support for using new Unity input system as a backend for gamepad, keyboard and mouse input (touch input coming later). This will be enabled when the Input System package (com.unity.inputsystem >= 1.0.0) is installed in Package Manager. You will also need to set Project Settings > Player > Active Input Handling to Both.
* Added LED color support for compatible (Dual Shock 4) controllers using Apple's Game Controller framework exposed through the native input module.
* Added PlayStation 5 controller support for native module (no rumble or LED features yet).

* Fixed error that can happen on application quit.
* Fixed duplicate device with Switch Pro Controller on newer macOS versions.
* Properly enable Unity UI `InControlInputModule` on PS5, GameCore and Stadia.

* Added `InputDeviceClass.TouchScreen` which is also set on the default touch device.
* Added `InControlManager.updateMode` which allows triggering custom updates (with `InputManager.Update()`), or using `MonoBehaviour.Update()` (default) or `MonoBehaviour.FixedUpdate()` as before. `InControlManager.useFixedUpdate` has been removed.
* Added additional Google Stadia controller model to the Windows native profile.
* Added additional GameCube adapter native profile on Windows.
* Added `byte[] SaveData()` and `LoadData( byte[] data )` to `PlayerActionSet` which works like `Save()` and `Load()`, but deals in byte arrays.

* Fixed bugs occurring when multiple `PlayerActionSet` instances listen simultaneously.
* Fixed compilation errors in Xcode build with iCade support in Unity 2019.3+

* Removed deprecated `CustomInputDeviceProfile`.
* Removed deprecated `InputManager.Setup()` and `InputManager.Reset()`.
* Removed deprecated `InputDeviceProfile.SupportedPlatforms` (use `IncludePlatforms` instead).
* Significant refactoring of `InputDeviceProfile` subclasses to unify how profiles definitions work between Unity profiles and Native profiles, and move toward serializable profiles in the future.

* Added support for some keys that may be on non-US keyboards.
* Added PowerA Nintendo Switch native profile on Mac.

* Fixed issue with menu items not showing up by moving them to a new InControl top-level menu.
* Fixed issue in native input module to correctly detect disconnected controllers.
* Fixed movement repeating logic in `InControlInputModule`.

### v1.7.1
* Added additional controllers supported by 360Controller 0.16.8 on Mac.
* Added NVIDIA Shield remote Android profile.

* BREAKING CHANGE: The singleton enforcement for InControlManager and TouchManager components was far too aggressive. It will now no longer destroy duplicate components automatically and, if redundant instances are detected in play mode, a warning will be shown in the console and the components will be disabled.

### v1.7.0
* Added additional controllers supported by 360Controller 0.16.6 on Mac.
* Added Xiaomi Remote profile for Android TV.

* BREAKING CHANGE: `InputDevice.LastChangeTick` has been replaced with `InputDevice.LastInputTick`
* BREAKING CHANGE: `InputDevice.LastChangedAfter()` has been replaced with `InputDevice.LastInputAfter()`
* BREAKING CHANGE: Whether a device is considered active is now determined by whether any control gives nonzero input rather than whether the control value changed. Controls or devices with their `Passive` property set will never be considered active. This makes device activation more intuitive and properly handles multiple devices being active simultaneously, enabling `InputManager.ActiveDevices` to exist. `InputManager.ActiveDevice` can now also be more "sticky" and will only be changed if the device is inactive, which helps mitigate certain broken situations where a mirrored virtual device exists in the OS.
