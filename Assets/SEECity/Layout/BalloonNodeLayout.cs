        // Concepts
        //
        // We associate each node i with its disc D_i around which its children
        // are placed. Let cp_i be the center and rad_i be the radius of D_i,
        // respectively. Let outer-radius out_rad_i be the minimum radious of the
        // circle which covers all the descendants of i when they are mapped onto
        // the same plane where D_i lies. Let outer-disc outer_disc_i for node i
        // be a disc with radius equal to out_rad_i (this is the disc containing
        // i at its center and the disc of all its desecendants).
        //
        // We define a reference point rp_i for node i as the intersection
        // point between the vertical line and horizontal line passing
        // through cp_i and i respectively, and an apex point as the point
        // which lies on the vertical line between rp_i and cp_i.
        //
        // We define apex height ah_i and reference height rh_i as the vertical
        // heights of ap_i and rp_i from cp_i, respectively. We define 
        // reference length rl_i as the length between i and rp_i. Each node
        // is associated with its attribute set AT_i = {rl_i, ah_i, rh_i},
        // which consists of reference length, apex, and reference height.
        //
        // We assume that for each hierarchical edge (i, j) in the tree, i is the
        // parent of j, and the root of the tree is at level 0.
        //
        // A reconfigurable disc tree (RDT) is a tree T(N, E) with each edge
        // (i, j) consisting of polylines [(i, rp_i), (rp_i, ap_i), (ap_i, j)]
        // where each length can be changed.
        //
        // We define a 3D RDT as one with zero reference length rl_i, and a 2D
        // RDT with non-zero reference length rl_i and zero reference height
        // rh_i for every node i, respectively. 
        //
        // Note that each node i in the 3D RDT is identical to its reference
        // point r_i, and each center point cp_i in the 2D RDT is identical to
        // its reference point rp_i (i.e., rp_i = cp_i).
        //
        // A 3D RDG can change its shape into a disc tree or a compact disc tree
        // by changing apex and reference height as follows. A disc tree is a
        // 3D RDT with zero apex and non-zero reference heights for each node. 
        // A compact disc tree is a 3D RDT with both of reference and apex heights 
        // equal to zero for each node at odd levels and with the identical apex
        // and reference heights for each node at even levels. A plane disc tree is
        // a 2D RDT which lies on the plane.
        // 
        // To draw a node i, cp_i, rad_i, and out_rad_i need to be known. The disc with 
        // radius rad_i and center point cp_i will be left empty. A circle will be drawn
        // with center point cp_i and radius out_rad_i representing i. The centers cp_k of
