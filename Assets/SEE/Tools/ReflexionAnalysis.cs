Purpose:
Implements incremental reflexion analysis. For detailed documentation refer to
the article:
"Incremental Reflexion Analysis", Rainer Koschke, Journal on Software Maintenance
and Evolution, 2011, DOI 10.1002/smr.542

The reflexion analysis calculates the reflexion graph describing the convergences,
absences, divergences between an architecture and its implementation. The following
graphs are needed to calculate the reflexion graph:

- architecture defines the expected architectural entities and their dependencies
(architectural entities may be hierarchical modeled by the part-of relation)
- the implementation model is represented in two separated graphs:
hierarchy graph describes the nesting of implementation entities
dependency graph describes the dependencies among the implementation entities
- mapping graph describes the partial mapping of implementation entities onto
architectural entities.

Open issues: implementation of incremental analysis is missing.
