Please be familiar with HDRP before attempting to use the UMA HDRP package. 

To use the UMA HDRP races, you must import the HDRP package from the package manager. 
Then, import the HDRP-Races unity package.

This package contains only the base races (HumanMaleHD, HumanFemalHD). 
To use any clothing, you will need to modify/convert the materials, update their UMAMaterials, 
and possibly edit/modify the mask textures as needed.

Thanks to Kenamis for supplying the HDRP races.
