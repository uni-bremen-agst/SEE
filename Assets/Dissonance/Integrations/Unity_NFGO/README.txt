Dissonance Netcode for GameObjects Integration
==============================================

This package integrates Dissonance Voice Chat (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/audio/dissonance-voice-chat-70078?aid=1100lJDF) with
the Unity "Netcode for GameObjects" (NFGO) networking system. To use this package you must have purchased and installed Dissonance - **you will
encounter build errors until you have done this**!

The included demo scene (Assets/Dissonance/Integrations/Unity_NFGO/Demo/NFGO Demo) demonstrates the basics of a voice
chat session running in a NFGO network session. Consult the readme file in the demo folder for details on how to run
the demo and what features it demonstrates.
