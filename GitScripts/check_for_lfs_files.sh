# This pre-commit hook verifies that no LFS-suitable files are being committed
# into the repository, as they should be placed within LFS instead.
# This check will trigger if at least one of the following is true
# ("Changes" refers to non-LFS changes):
#
# 1. Changes contain a file bigger than 10 MB.
# 2. Changes as a whole (additions only) constitute more than 50 MB.
# 3. Changes contain directories within `Assets` which are not a part of SEE.
#    These should be placed in LFS as they may be subject to copyright
#    and thus should not be contained in the (potentially in the future) public
#    GitHub repository.
#
# Note that this script is only run as part of CI, because we can only check
# blob sizes after the commit has been made, so it can't be run as a
# pre-commit hook.

# Maximum allowed file size.
FILE_SIZE="10 * 2^20" # 10 MB.
# Maximum allowed total diff size.
DIFF_SIZE="50 * 2^20" # 50 MB.
