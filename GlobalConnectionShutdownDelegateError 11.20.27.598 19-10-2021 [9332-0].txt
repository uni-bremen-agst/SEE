Comment: Error while executing global connection shutdown delegates for [TCP-E-S] 192.168.178.100:52720 -> 192.168.178.90:55555 (tMtjH3VaHECfl1F0fqDWsg). Ensure any shutdown exceptions are caught in your own code.

Base Exception Type: UnityEngine.UnityException: FindObjectsOfType can only be called from the main thread.
Constructors and field initializers will be executed from the loading thread when loading a scene.
Don't use this function in the constructor or field initializers, instead move initialization code to the Awake or Start function.
